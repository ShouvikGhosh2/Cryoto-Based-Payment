# Cryoto-Based-Payment
A crypto-based payment gateway is a digital payment processing system that allows merchants and service providers to accept payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and others. It functions similarly to traditional payment gateways (such as PayPal or Stripe), but instead of processing payments in fiat currencies (like USD, EUR, etc.), it processes payments in digital currencies.
